To run the inital prototype,
1. Compile and build libtorrent library present in $REPO/libtorrent using 
	a. cd libtorrent
	b. ./configure
	c. make
2. In the $REPO directory, type make (or make im0)
3. Finally run runme.sh present in $REPO directory
	(mini_httpd shows false error like couldn't bind to the address)

This will run the mini_httpd webserver which is glued with libtorrent-rasterbar

The prerequisite is boost libraries which is needed to compile libtorrent.
 
Basic info about mini_httpd
1. Default port is 8080
2. default webserver dir is www/ (not /www)

Instructions to demonstrate prototype:
1. Create .torrent file and place the torrent file in the webserver directory.
2. In the browser, open http://localhost:8080/torrent_name ( Do not include '/' after torrent_name)
3. It will show false index showing all the files present in the torrent.
4. Click on any file to start downloading it.
5. Browser will show busy and will not move further but the file will start downloading in the www/ directory.
  Browser will not serve the file even after completion of download (It's a bug, I will solve it ASAP)  (SOLVED)
